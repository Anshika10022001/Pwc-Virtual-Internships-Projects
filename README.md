# Pwc Virtual Internships Projects
# Task 1 - CALL CENTRE
## Project Description
Power BI Dashboards which analysis a Call Centre Data and organized it into a visually appealing dashboard layout.

## Outline of Problem
TELECOMS FIGHT HARD FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS.
A CLIENT NEEDS HELP.
THE CALL CENTRE MANAGER CANT SEE WHAT THE TRENDS ARE.
So creating a dashboard in Power BI that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset. 

Possible KPIs include:

- Overall customer satisfaction
- Overall calls answered/abandoned
- Calls by time
- Average speed of answer
- Agent’s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

## Analysis Framework
- Downloaded dataset of PwC internship from Forage website.
- Data rectification and assessment: The data was rectified and assessed in Power BI(Power Query) to ensure its accuracy and consistency. This involved removing duplicates, columns rectification, removing noise values, fixing errors, and verifying the information against other sources.
- Dashboard creation: The final output of the project was a dashboard that presented the data in an easily digestible format. The dashboard provided insights on the call centre data analysis.

## Future Scope

- Performance Tracking: The dashboard can be used to monitor key metrics and KPIs over time, enabling Claire to track performance trends and identify areas for improvement.

- Real-Time Monitoring: By connecting the dashboard to live data feeds, Claire can gain real-time insights into call center operations, allowing for immediate actions and adjustments.

- Decision Support: The dashboard can assist Claire in making data-driven decisions, such as optimizing staffing levels, identifying training needs, or implementing process improvements.

- Predictive Analytics: By incorporating predictive models, the dashboard can provide forecasts and insights into future call volumes, customer satisfaction, or agent performance, aiding in proactive planning.

- Stakeholder Reporting: The dashboard can serve as a reporting tool for communicating call center performance to key stakeholders, such as management or executives, fostering transparency and accountability.

- Continuous Improvement: Through regular analysis of the dashboard data and feedback loops, Claire can continuously refine and optimize call center operations to enhance customer experience and maximize efficiency.


# Task 2 - CUSTOMER CHURN AND RETENTION
## Project Description
Power BI Dashboards which analysis Customer Churn and Retention and organized it into a visually appealing dashboard layout.

## Outline of Problem
the Retention Manager from the telecom reaches out to you directly. He asked if you can put together a dashboard about customer retention.
In addition, to better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:
- Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
- The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
- Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
- We  have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
- We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management
- The Retentions Manager has provided some information, have a look through the resource section.

Create a dashboard in Power BI that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset. 

The inputs in the dataset:
• Customers who left within the last month
• Services each customer has signed up for: phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech
support, and streaming TV and movies
• Customer account information: how long as a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, total charges
and number of tickets opened in the categories administrative and technical
• Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

## Future Scope
- Early Warning System: The dashboard can act as an early warning system by identifying customers who are showing signs of potential churn. This allows businesses to proactively intervene and take measures to retain those customers before they churn.

- Customer Segmentation: The dashboard can provide insights into customer segments that are more prone to churn. By understanding the characteristics and behaviors of these segments, businesses can tailor their retention strategies to address their specific needs and preferences.

- Retention Strategy Evaluation: The dashboard can help evaluate the effectiveness of different retention strategies and initiatives implemented by the business. It allows businesses to assess which strategies are yielding positive results and make data-driven decisions about where to allocate resources for maximum impact.

- Predictive Analytics: The dashboard can be enhanced with predictive models to forecast the likelihood of customer churn. By leveraging historical data and customer behavior patterns, businesses can proactively identify customers at risk of churn and take preventive actions to retain them.

- Personalized Retention Campaigns: The dashboard can enable businesses to create personalized retention campaigns based on customer insights. By analyzing customer preferences, transaction history, and engagement patterns, businesses can design targeted offers, loyalty programs, or customer-specific interventions to improve retention rates.

- Executive Reporting and Decision Making: The dashboard serves as a reporting tool to present key churn and retention metrics to executives and stakeholders. It enables data-driven decision making, facilitates strategic discussions, and helps align business objectives with customer retention goals.
